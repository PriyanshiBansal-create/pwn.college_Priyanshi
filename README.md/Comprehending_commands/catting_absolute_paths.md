Challenge 2: Catting Absolute Paths

What the challenge asks
Practice using cat with absolute paths. The flag is placed directly at /flag and I need to read it using its absolute path.

My solve
Flag: pwn.college{wsWp3MGnGpWTwvhGIyaLv7hH8vg.QX5ETO0wCN5kjNzEzW}

Simple solution using absolute path:
'''bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{wsWp3MGnGpWTwvhGIyaLv7hH8vg.QX5ETO0wCN5kjNzEzW}
'''

What I learned
Can specify file paths as absolute paths with cat
